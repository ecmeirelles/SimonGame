The game has four colored buttons, each producing a specific \n
sound when it is pressed or activated by the computer. A round \n
in the game consists of the computer lighting up one or more \n
buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce \n
that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the \n
number of buttons to be pressed increases.
